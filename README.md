# iFood-EDA
iFood is a Brazilian online food ordering and food delivery platform, operating in Brazil and Colombia. The company holds over 80% market share of the food delivery sector in Brazil. It is majority-owned by Dutch-based Prosus (part of Naspers) and its Brazillian investment firm Movile, as well as then UK-based Just Eat. Just Eat Takeaway.com, Just Eat's successor, is in talks with Prosus to sell its 33% stake in iFood.  It merged its businesses in Argentina and Colombia with rivals PedidosYa in August 2018 and Domicilios.com in March 2021 respectively, brands of Delivery Hero which is also owned by Prosus. It operated as SinDelantal in Mexico until December 2020.
